# rime-emoji
A handcrafted emoji input scheme for [RIME](https://github.com/rime/home).

## How it's done
The emoji list got from https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data/blob/master/emoji.json is processed to generate a working `dict.yaml`, meeting the requirement of a [RIME](https://github.com/rime/home) input scheme. Tags (triggers when typing) are then finetuned to make the `dict.yaml` more usable.

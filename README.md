# rime-emoji
A handcrafted emoji input scheme for [RIME](https://github.com/rime/home).

## How it's done
The emoji list is exported from [Unicode, Inc.](https://unicode.org/emoji) as plaintext file, and edited with simplicity and minimalism in mind. The list file was then again converted to meet the requirement of a [RIME](https://github.com/rime/home) input scheme.
